# CIFAR-10-Image-Recognition

### Goal

Implement Transfer Learning using pretrained RESNET-18 model classify images of CIFAR-10 Dataset.

### Tools Used

Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pytorch, MatplotLib

### Overview

The project has two parts:

####  1. Feature Extraction

Using pretrained RESNET-18 model to extract features
Use those features in a model and Optimize model using SGD optimizer to classify images.


####  2. Fine-Tuning 

Using pretrained RESNET-18 Model to fine-tune using SGD to get best results.
